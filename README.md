## Building :hammer:

**ImagIn** development has reached its end unexpectedly due to the covid-19 crisis. However some members of the *Silvergrain* team are still going to work on it. Therefore be sure to run the following command to be sure to have the latest stable version before using.

```bash
git pull
```

### GUI

The software is made to be run with the GUI.

```bash
make all
./imagin.out
```

### CLI

The CLI is meant only to test the modules using samples choosed by the developers. Follow these steps to download them:

```bash
cd src/tools
./samples -h
```

Once the images have been downloaded, run this:

```bash
make cli
./imagin_cli.out
```
